# Video Scene Detection based on Optimal Sequential Grouping algorithm

Here you can find implementations of algorithms from the followinf papers:

- Robust and Efficient Video Scene Detection Using Optimal Sequential Grouping [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7823628]
- Optimally Grouped Deep Features Using Normalized Cost for Video Scene Detection [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3206025.3206055]

The problem is temporally dividing a video into semantic scenes. The core idea is to solve problem as an optimization process of sequential grouping task.

This repo doesn't contain feature extraction and pairwise distances calculation steps.

Its goal is to demonstrate algorithms implementations on some synthetic data.
